                I am a lifelong tech enthusiast who loves to build products and immersive experiences for others.
                I am currently looking for an opportunity to work with like-minded individuals
                where I can continue to learn and grow as a tech professional.
                Drawing on my background in music, I leverage my creativity and engineering skills
                to bring my visions to life.
